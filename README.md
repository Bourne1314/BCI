##Brain Computer Interface Project

This project was aimed at operation of a motorized wheelchair using brainwaves for physically challenged people. During this project wheelchair was modified to be wirelessly operated using bluetooth, an EEG device was fabricated (inspired from the work of OpenBCI team), and a Matlab GUI environment was developed.


These folders contains some of the codes of the test environment developed for validation of different existing techniques. These techniques of feature extraction and classification were tested on EEG samples taken from fabricated 8 channel EEG device. Some folders also contain the raw data collected during the tests as a *.mat file with the name designating the mental task conducted. Although the folders are not well organized, most codes are commented.
